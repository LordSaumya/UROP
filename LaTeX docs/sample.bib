abstract = {A core challenge for both physics and artificial intelligence (AI) is symbolic regression: finding a symbolic expression that matches data from an unknown function. Although this problem is likely to be NP-hard in principle, functions of practical interest often exhibit symmetries, separability, compositionality, and other simplifying properties. In this spirit, we develop a recursive multidimensional symbolic regression algorithm that combines neural network fitting with a suite of physics-inspired techniques. We apply it to 100 equations from the Feynman Lectures on Physics, and it discovers all of them, while previous publicly available software cracks only 71; for a more difficult physics-based test set, we improve the state-of-the-art success rate from 15 to 90%.},

@article{Lemos2023,
abstract = {We present an approach for using machine learning to automatically discover the governing equations and unknown properties (in this case, masses) of real physical systems from observations. We train a â€˜graph neural network' to simulate the dynamics of our Solar System's Sun, planets, and large moons from 30 years of trajectory data. We then use symbolic regression to correctly infer an analytical expression for the force law implicitly learned by the neural network, which our results showed is equivalent to Newton's law of gravitation. The key assumptions our method makes are translational and rotational equivariance, and Newton's second and third laws of motion. It did not, however, require any assumptions about the masses of planets and moons or physical constants, but nonetheless, they, too, were accurately inferred with our method. Naturally, the classical law of gravitation has been known since Isaac Newton, but our results demonstrate that our method can discover unknown laws and hidden properties from observed data.},
